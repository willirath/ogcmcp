# Wind-Stress Parameterisation: FESOM2 vs MITgcm

*Cross-model comparison using the MCP tools — generated by Codex (o3), 2026-02-25*

## Overview
Both models can compute surface momentum fluxes from bulk formulae, but they
handle the impact of ocean surface velocity differently. FESOM2 subtracts the
modelled surface current from the atmospheric wind before forming the stress,
while MITgcm’s default bulk-forcing path uses the atmospheric wind alone unless
an alternative flux package (e.g. CHEAPAML) is chosen or the user provides
pre-adjusted “relative” winds.

## FESOM2
- The NCAR/CORE bulk routine (`ncar_ocean_fluxes_mode`) iterates on drag and
  exchange coefficients following Large & Yeager (2004/2009). The relative wind
  is formed explicitly by subtracting the model’s surface velocity from the
  forcing wind before computing the magnitude (`dux = u_wind - u_w`,
  `dvy = v_wind - v_w` → `u = sqrt(dux**2 + dvy**2)`), so the resulting stress
  is `τ = ρ_air · C_d · |U_rel| · U_rel`. (See
  `FESOM2/src/gen_bulk_formulae.F90:126-214`.)
- The forcing documentation clarifies the `Swind` control:
  > “Swind=0.0 couples ocean surface currents back to the wind stress following
  > Renault et al. (2019); a value of 1 removes ocean-current influence entirely,
  > values between 0 and 1 partially reduce the applied stress.”
  (`forcing_configuration.rst:1-11`). This makes current feedback configurable
  but enabled by default when stress is computed from winds.

## MITgcm
- The standard ocean bulk pathway reads 10 m winds and passes them straight
  into `BULKF_FORMULA_LANL`; wind speed is computed as
  `us = sqrt(uwind**2 + vwind**2)` if not already supplied (`MITgcm/pkg/bulk_force/
  bulkf_forcing.F:70-110` and `bulkf_formula_lanl.F:118-152`). No subtraction of
  the model’s surface velocity occurs, so the stress depends solely on the
  atmospheric wind unless the input winds already include a current correction.
- MITgcm does have packages that operate with relative winds, e.g.
  `CHEAPAML_COARE3_FLUX`, whose argument `windSq` is documented as the “relative
  wind (vs surface motion) speed square” (`MITgcm/pkg/cheapaml/
  cheapaml_coare3_flux.F:14-34`). Coupled setups can also feed MITgcm winds that
  already subtract `u_surface`, but the default bulk forcing does not.

## Takeaway
- **FESOM2:** Accounts for ocean surface velocity in its default bulk stress
  computation; `Swind` allows users to weaken or disable the coupling.
- **MITgcm:** Default bulk forcing ignores surface currents; to mimic FESOM2’s
  behaviour you must supply relative winds (through CHEAPAML, a coupler, or
  pre-processed forcing files).

## MCP Tool Usage
This comparison relied on both MCP servers for authoritative documentation and
source references:

### MITgcm calls
1. `search_docs_tool("wind stress", top_k=3)` → surfaced the relevant sections
   in `phys_pkgs/bulk_force.rst`, confirming the terms used in the bulk flux
   description.
2. `get_source_tool(name="BULKF_FORCING", package="bulk_force")` → showed that
   the default bulk path feeds `uwind`, `vwind`, and `wspeed` directly into the
   flux routine with no current subtraction.
3. `get_source_tool(name="BULKF_FORMULA_LANL", package="bulk_force")` →
   highlighted the line that rebuilds `us = sqrt(uw*uw + vw*vw)` when only
   winds are provided.
4. `get_source_tool(name="CHEAPAML_COARE3_FLUX", package="cheapaml")` → noted
   that `windSq` is explicitly the *relative* wind versus surface motion,
   documenting how MITgcm can include surface currents when CHEAPAML is used.

### FESOM2 calls
1. `search_docs_tool("wind stress", top_k=3)` plus
   `search_docs_tool("Swind", …)` → retrieved the `forcing_configuration.rst`
   snippet explaining how `Swind` scales the current feedback when stress is
   computed from winds.
2. `get_source_tool(name="ncar_ocean_fluxes_mode", module="gen_bulk")` →
   exposed the NCAR bulk implementation where `dux = u_wind - u_w` and
   `dvy = v_wind - v_w` form the relative wind that drives the stress.
